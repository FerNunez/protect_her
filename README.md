**Overview** 

"Protect Her" is a silly game prototype developed in Rust using the Bevy game engine. 

The game’s theme centers around a superhero pill tasked with protecting a woman’s egg from fertilization.
Sperm cells attempt to reach and fertilize the egg, while the pill defends by eliminating the sperm cells and escorting the egg to a safe exit.
